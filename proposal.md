## Introduction

The emergence of generative AI marks a revolutionary leap in how knowledge is accessed, recombined, and redistributed. As language models and image generators gain the capacity to produce high-quality content that mimics human creativity, a critical issue has surfaced: the lack of a transparent, enforceable standard for content attribution.

While open web communities have long emphasized citation and traceability, most current AI models regenerate information without disclosing the sources they rely on. This practice, often justified by the claim of abstracted 'learning,' risks severing the vital connection between creators and their contributions.

## Why Attribution Matters

At its core, content attribution ensures accountability, preserves intellectual integrity, and encourages a healthy knowledge ecosystem. In academia, journalism, and scientific discourse, citation is foundational. If AI-generated content is to be trusted and adopted widely, similar norms must govern its outputs.

Without clear attribution:
- Creators cannot be fairly recognized or compensated.
- Misinformation may propagate without means of verification.
- Users and developers are left with opaque audit trails, weakening trust in AI systems.

## The Attribution Gap in LLM Systems

Large Language Models (LLMs) do not currently disclose the origins of the knowledge they output. This is not merely a technical limitation; it reflects a gap in system design philosophy. The output may contain repackaged versions of copyrighted texts, academic findings, or niche community insights — yet the interface provides no contextual markers or references.

This lack of traceability leads to:
- Ambiguity in legal ownership.
- Ethical uncertainty in education and publishing.
- Structural asymmetry in the knowledge economy.

To address these, source-aware architectures and data lineage encoding should be considered fundamental, not optional features.

## Proposal: A Public Attribution Protocol

We propose an open, multi-stakeholder protocol to standardize AI content attribution. This should include:

1. **Source Labeling Standard**
   - Incorporate optional citation markers in outputs.
   - Define confidence levels for inferred sources.

2. **Transparency Layers in Model Design**
   - Enable provenance tracking at dataset and token level.
   - Support interpretable model outputs (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation).

3. **Ethical Disclosure Principles**
   - Distinguish between general knowledge and content derived from identifiable creators.
   - Default to attribution when in doubt, with opt-out mechanisms for public domain.

4. **DAO-Led Curation and Incentive Alignment**
   - Encourage decentralized stewardship of attribution metadata.
   - Reward contributors via Web3-native tokens or recognition systems.

## Broader Impact: Trust, Fairness, and the Future

Attribution is not a mere courtesy — it is a foundation of fairness. By empowering creators, informing users, and holding systems accountable, a transparent attribution layer will reinforce public trust in AI technologies.

Furthermore, embracing attribution can:
- Reduce hallucinations by rooting content in verified knowledge.
- Foster new incentive models for data sharing.
- Bridge the gap between open knowledge and ethical automation.

## Closing Thought

In a world increasingly shaped by algorithmic outputs, transparency is not optional — it is a necessity. Attribution serves as both a safeguard and a guidepost. As AI continues to transform how we learn, speak, and create, let us also evolve the principles that preserve meaning and merit.

> LLM 기반 학습 시스템이 생성하는 콘텐츠에 대해 핵심 근거와 출처의 명시가 이루어지지 않는다면, 그 신뢰성과 투명성은 근본적으로 흔들릴 수밖에 없다.  
> 따라서 이는 기술적 한계로 회피될 수 있는 사안이 아니라, 오히려 ‘책임 있는 생성 AI’를 위해 우선적으로 준비되어야 할 구조적 기준이라 할 수 있다.

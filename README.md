# AI-Generated Content Attribution Proposal

This repository contains a public proposal submitted to the W3C AIKR (Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation) Community Group.

## ðŸ“„ Proposal Summary

This document outlines a suggested standard for source attribution in AI-generated content â€” especially for LLM-based systems. The aim is to promote traceability, fairness, and transparency in the age of generative AI.

We argue that attribution is not optional but fundamental to trustworthy and ethical AI.
